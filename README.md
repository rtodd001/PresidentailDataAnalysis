CS 105 Final Project
For Phase 1 of the project we scraped our data from the websites (http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=b4747822-277e-4d2c-b896-eb4e04672c09 as an example) and cleaned it. The website is not very organized, and all of the tables are named the same thing so our robot could not scrape the data in a very meaningful way. We then created a python script in JupyterLab to clean the data and seperate it into the 34 different tables that were originally found on the website. In each survey folder there is one csv file named surveyusa1/2/4.csv with the raw data gathered, and 34 other survey_#.csv files with the separated, reordered, and cleaned data.
